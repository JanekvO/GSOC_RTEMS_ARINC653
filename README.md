GSOC_RTEMS_ARINC653
===================

Google Summer of Code project for RTEMS (http://www.rtems.org/). In this project 
we're trying to make available the ARINC653 calls on POK for RTEMS (only if
RTEMS is running virtualized on POK).

The folders in POK/* are basically code and/or changes concerning POK whilst 
the folder RTEMS/* is the folder with the changes on and for RTEMS.

# TODO
- Get a seperate project folder for my changes on rtems. I have used the example hello project thus far but making a seperate project.
